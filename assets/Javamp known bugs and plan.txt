===Known Issues===
== UI ==
- =FIXED= 	Doubleclick in tracklist should seek playlist scrollbar to selected track
- =FIXED=	Drag and drop from library to playlist does not add at proper playlist index
- =Good Enough=	ListView style incomplete
- =Good Enough=	TableArea style incomplete
- =Good Enough=	Media controls style incomplete
- =Good Enough=	Search Bar style incomplete
- =FIXED=	Unable to resize columns in tracklist
- =LOW=		Tracklist track # column sorts 1,10,11,...,2 rather than 1,2,...,10,11
- =Good Enough=	Directory Scan style incomplete
- =LOW=		Duration and Current Title/Artist/Album displays not scrollable
- =FIXED=         Directory Scan and About windows not modal.

== Data Structures ==
- =FIXED=	Selecting Artist/Title column in playlist view does not update Playlist data stucture
                - Disabled artist/title clicking for now.
- =HIGH=	jaudiotagger sometimes silently fails to read id3 tags/artwork
                - Still unsolved. 'Solution' is an additional fallback tagreader.
- =MEDIUM=	Sporatic error missing database on startup
                - Can't reproduce.
- =LOW=         AudioDB queryDB needs extra boolean parameter for LIKE/= toggle
                - Needed for proper search
- =LOW=		Type safety warnings from tableview cells
- =FIXED=	AudioFile has unused data fields

== Media Library ==
- =FIXED= 	(No Genre)/(No Artist)/(No Album) nonfunctional
- =FIXED=	First time doubleclicking track to load into playlist fails to update playlist or display but still plays.
                - JavaFX Tableview bug relating to scrollTo
- =MEDIUM=	Directory Scan Task.cancel() results in stack dump
                - Might be fixed
- =MEDIUM=	Genre/Artist/Album list doubleclick rarely fails to update playlistview
                - Probably a concurrency issue. Happens mostly on (All Genres)
- =LOW=		searchArtist/AlbumList needs to ignore case sensitivity

== Playback ==
- =FIXED=	Last track continues to play when repeat is off
- =HIGH=        Rapidly changing tracks will cause MediaPlayer to throw an exception since it is not ready.
                - Major bug. Need to find a way to call attachMediaControls() in the runnable handler while also calling internal methods
                    for the MediaPlayerWrapper class.
                - Workaround: Disabling buttons for short period of time/extra guards in MediaPlayerWrapper.
- =LOW=		Duration sometimes fails to calculate properly
- =FIXED=	Status indicator does not return to stop at end of playlist playback when repeat is off
- =LOW=         Excessive file handles/stale file handles prevent sleep when stopped.
                - MediaPlayer won't release file handles. Prevents tag editor from modifying file that was recently played.

== Other ==
- =LOW=         JAudioTagger is incredibly noisy about errors. Writing them to stderr even when they are caught.
